# Egocentric-Cooking-Motion-Dataset
abstracth: 
In this work, we introduce a novel dataset featuring hand pose annotations 
for video clips sourced from Epic Kitchen, an existing cooking dataset. 
By augmenting the dataset with this additional annotation, we aim to advance 
research in the realm of multi-modality for cooking robots developments.
